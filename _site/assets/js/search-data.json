Have a space $X$ and the data is determined by a distribution $\\rho$ on $X$. A model (fit) is another distribution $\\rho’$ on $X$. For now we meed to assume that $X$ has a fixed metric $d$ and furthermore that means/centers of mass are defined for $\\rho$ and $\\rho’$, call these $x_{\\rho}$ and $x_{\\rho’}$ in $X$.

    "content": "You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: . def print_hi(name) puts \"Hi, #{name}\" end print_hi('Tom') #=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk. ",

This will automatically generate an ordered list of anchor links to various sections of the page based on headings and heading levels. There may be occasions where you’re using a heading and you don’t want it to show up in the TOC, so to skip a particular heading use the {: .no_toc } CSS class. Example . # Navigation Structure {: .no_toc } ## {: .no_toc .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} . This example skips the page name heading (#) from the TOC, as well as the heading for the Table of Contents itself (##) because it is redundant, followed by the table of contents itself. To get an unordered list, replace 1. TOC above by - TOC. Collapsible Table of Contents . The Table of Contents can be made collapsible using the &lt;details&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; elements , as in the following example. The attribute open (expands the Table of Contents by default) and the styling with {: .text-delta } are optional. &lt;details open markdown=\"block\"&gt; &lt;summary&gt; &lt;/summary&gt; {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} &lt;/details&gt; . The result is shown at the top of this page ({:toc} can be used only once on each page). ",
